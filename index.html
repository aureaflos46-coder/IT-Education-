    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Have you ever felt stuck, like opportunities are passing you by, and you wish you could create solutions instead of waiting for someone else? I’ve been there too. I struggled to find work, watched others get ahead, and wondered how I could make a real impact.</p>
    <p>Then I discovered coding and IT. Suddenly, doors opened. I could solve problems, create tools, and even help others learn. Now, I’m sharing this knowledge with people just like you — to teach you how to code, build projects, and improve your life.</p>
